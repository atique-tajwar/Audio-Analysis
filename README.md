# WAV File Analysis

A simple WAV file analysis project that demonstrates basic audio signal processing in Python.  
It covers importing a `.wav` file, determining the length of the data and the sampling rate, and analyzing the audio in the frequency domain using both **FFT** and a **spectrogram**.

## Features
- Import WAV audio files
- Extract sampling rate and signal length
- Frequency analysis with **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
- Time-frequency analysis with **Spectrogram**
- Visualizations for better understanding of the signal content

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
